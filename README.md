These are prjects from my CSE 320: Systems Fundamentals II course. Please read 
these simple description before looking further. Thanks you :)

**hw0:**  This is where we started the course, including signing ACADEMIC HONESTY STATEMENT 
shown below and setting up git environment in our virtual machine.

**hw0:**  This is a command line utility to encrypt and decrypt strings and files by either Polybius cipher or Fractionated Morse cipher. Using "-h" command or checking "hw1/include/const.h" for details of this project.

**hw2:** This project couldn't reflect my skills since I only had one day to finish it due to some unexpected accidents. My work for this project is to fix compile, memory leak and functionality issue existed in the original code.  Only compile and memory leak issues were able to be fixed.

**hw3:** This project is all about dynamic memory allocator. It's my favorite project.

**hw4:** This is a shell that offers these functions: scripting support, redirection support, builtins, ability to run executables and simple job control.

**hw5:** This is an in-memory, multi-threaded, caching server functionally similar to Memcached.


For those who are taking this course, please be aware that you should not use any of my code for your own projects.
